# Write a for loop which displays "Hello," plus each name in the list, e.g. "Hello Keno"

list = ["William", "Keno", "Ope", "Mohammed", "Misan"]
# add a for loop
for i in list:
  print("Hello",i)

#RANGE PRACTICE
# Practice writing for loops using range

# print the numbers from 4 to 14
for i in range(4,15):
  print(i)
# print the numbers from -10 to 10
for i in range(-10,11):
  print(i)
# print the numbers from 1 to 20, counting by 2s
for i in range(1,21,2):
  print(i)
# print the numbers from 1000 to 500, counting backwards by 100s
for i in range(1000,400,-100):
  print(i)
